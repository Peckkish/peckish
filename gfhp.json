            "Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light",

            "Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing",
